* Alembic:

- It is a tool that allows us to work with SQLAlchemy and ORMS that uses SQLAlchemy for us to be able to carry out database
migrations on our SQL database.

- Helps us to crete migration env using templates.

* Importance of migration:

- It help us to make changes to our database without having to lose data.

* Migration Env:

- Env which help us to run our migrations, inside this migration env we get to create versions or files that describes
the changes we have been able to do on our DB with time.

- So whenever we are creating a change to our db we are going to create a migration, and that migration will be refected
inside a file. That file will be called as the version file and inside that file will be the changes to the structure of
the db that we are suggesting and onces we have been able to suggest those changes then we shall finally go ahead and make
those changes refect within our database.
